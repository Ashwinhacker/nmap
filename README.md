# nmap
web scanning tool in python
Nmap, short for "Network Mapper," is a powerful open-source tool used for network exploration and security auditing. It is commonly integrated into Kali Linux, a widely-used distribution for penetration testing and ethical hacking.

Nmap enables users to discover hosts and services on a computer network, thus creating a map of the network's structure. It employs various scanning techniques to achieve this, including TCP connect scans, SYN scans, UDP scans, and more. These scans help identify active hosts, open ports, and the services running on those ports.

One of Nmap's key features is its flexibility and extensibility. It supports a wide range of options and arguments, allowing users to customize their scans according to specific requirements. Additionally, Nmap offers scripting capabilities through the Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE), which enables users to automate tasks, perform advanced vulnerability detection, and gather additional information about target systems.

Nmap's versatility makes it indispensable for network administrators, security professionals, and penetration testers. It can be used for various purposes, including network inventory, vulnerability assessment, patch management, and network monitoring.

However, it's essential to use Nmap responsibly and ethically, as indiscriminate or unauthorized scanning of networks can violate privacy laws and terms of service agreements. When used appropriately, Nmap is a valuable tool for maintaining the security and integrity of computer networks.
